## AWS EBS
1. It is a cloud-based storage service that provides durable, high-performance block storage for use with Amazon EC2 Instances.

2. It works like virtual hard-drive, allowing you to store and access data even when your EC2 instances are stopped or terminated.

3. We can attach multiple EBS to Instance.

4. Region & AZ specific

5. Build in Redundancy - EBS volumes are automatically replicated within the same availability  zone to prevent data loss due to hardware failures.

6. Different Volume types: Gp2/3, io1/2, st1, sc1
7. Allow encryption & snapshot for backup.

8. Scalable ( volume can be resizable)
 - No data loss will occur during resizing.
 - No need to restart the EC2 instance suring the process.
