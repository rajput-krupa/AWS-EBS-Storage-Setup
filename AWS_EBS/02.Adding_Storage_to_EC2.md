For Adding storage, we will start with creating an EC2 Instance.
I have already created a instance "mywebserver"

Here we have to go to the "volumes" in Elastic Block Store

## Now when we will delete the instance, the storage automatically gets deleted. What if I want the storage to be safe even when the instance is deleted
 First, whenever you are making a instance
 Follow usual steps and then--> go to configure storage --> click "advance" --> expand --> then turn off the delete on termination option.
